    <h1>GW2-SRS: DATA MODELLING</h1>
</div>


This folder will be used to store and explain the modelling of GW2 data as well as the analysis of it. The objective is creating a database capable of containing all information needed. In this particular case, we will use MongoDB to store JSON files and SQLite so we can use SQL queries too.

- We will be using the normal Atlas Cluster for MongoDB. We will also use Compass to check data and VSCode extension for MongoDB databases.

- As for SQLite, we will use a tool called [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/), this tools let us write queries and check data as we desire.

Thanks to Excalidraw, I designed a small schema to explain how the route can be approached:
